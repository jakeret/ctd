# Material for the Client Technology Day, ML meets SWE, Scala vs. Python Battle

Abstract:

Machine learning is said to become "just" one more SWE discipline. Or the other way round: Most of SWE will have to deal with data science to some extent.
If that is not a misconception, it means that SW engineers and data analysts will need to team up to build a new breed of products: "Smart Applications" of whatever nature.
We'll attempt to shed some light on what that actually may mean for our every-day working lives.
We'll ask questions like: 
 - How do model artifacts end up in Enterprise code?
 - Is there a language barrier between SWE and DA?
 - What integration or deployment patterns are there?
 - What ML as a Service components will be at our avail?
